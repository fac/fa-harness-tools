# fa-harness-tools

#### https://rubygems.org/gems/fa-harness-tools

FreeAgent-specific pre-flight checks and tools that are designed to work in [Harness](https://harness.io).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fa-harness-tools'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fa-harness-tools

## Usage

Examples below use [variables defined by Harness](https://docs.harness.io/article/9dvxcegm90-variables) so should be suitable to use directly in Harness scripts.

Full scripts that can be used in Harness are available in the [examples/](examples/) directory.

### Optional environment variables

* To access private repositories, `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` must be exported, containing a valid [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) for GitHub

### check-branch-brotection

Check the new build/commit being deployed is on the master branch:

```
bundle exec exe/check-branch-protection -r ${artifact.source.repositoryName} -e ${env.name} -b ${artifact.buildNo}
```

(Branch name etc can be changed, see `--help` for more options.)

### check-forward-deploy

Using a Git tag indicating the last deployment, check that the new commit being deployed is a descendant of the current commit:

```
bundle exec exe/check-forward-deploy -r ${artifact.source.repositoryName} -e ${env.name} -b ${artifact.buildNo}
```

(Tag prefix etc can be changed, see `--help` for more options.)

### check-recent-deploy

Using Git tags indicating recent deployments, check the commit being deployed is one of the last X commits or newer. Allows a user to rollback by X deployments.

```
bundle exec exe/check-recent-deploy -r ${artifact.source.repositoryName} -e ${env.name} -b ${artifact.buildNo}
```

(Allowed rollback count and tag prefix etc can be changed, see `--help` for more options.)

### check-schedule

Check the current time is within the deployment window of Mon-Thu 9am to 4pm, or Fri 9am to 12pm, using local London time.

```
bundle exec exe/check-schedule
```

### create-deployment-tag

Creates a Git tag in the project repository to indicate the deployment has happened:

```
bundle exec exe/create-deployment-tag -r ${artifact.source.repositoryName} -e ${env.name} -b ${artifact.buildNo}
```

(Tagger's name and email address etc can be changed, see `--help` for more options.)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`. After your PR is merged to master, the CICD GitHub Action workflow will release to RubyGems automatically:
Gem is hosted publicly here:
https://rubygems.org/gems/fa-harness-tools

The Ruby version used matches the one from the `harness/delegate` Docker image.
